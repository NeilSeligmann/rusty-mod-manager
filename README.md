## Supported Games
Currently, the mod manager is being developed with Bethesda games (Skyrim specially) in mind. There are plans for supporting more games in the future!

Rusty Mod Manager manages your mods and downloads, but in the end these are simply folders.
While the games you want to play may not be specifically supported, they might still work.

## How does it work?
When running a game/executable the mod manager deploys a Virtual File-System (VFS), using [UnionFS-Fuse](https://github.com/rpodgorny/unionfs-fuse). This makes all of your enabled mods appear transaprently to the game you are running.

## Requirements
- [UnionFS-Fuse](https://github.com/rpodgorny/unionfs-fuse): For deploying the mods/saves/settings
- icoutils/wrestool _(Optional)_: Used for extracting `.exe` file data

## Handle NXM Scheme
In order to handle NXM links you need to run the executable with the argument `./RustyModManager nxm [NXM-LINK-HERE]`.

You can create a `.desktop` file in your applications (Ex. `~/.local/share/applications`) with the content:
```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Categories=Game;
Name=Rusty Mod Manager (NXM Handler)
Comment=A native mod manager for linux.
Exec={PATH_TO_EXECUTABLE} nxm %u
Path={PATH_TO_EXECUTABLE_FOLDER}
MimeType=x-scheme-handler/nxm;
Terminal=false
Type=Application
```

Replace `{PATH_TO_EXECUTABLE}` and `{PATH_TO_EXECUTABLE_FOLDER}` with their respective values.

For now it is recommended that you have an instance of the mod manager already open, so it will receive the IPC request to download the file.

## Development
The mod manager has been developed using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) + [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) + [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

How to run locally:
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies with `bun install`
3. Run project with `bun run dev`
